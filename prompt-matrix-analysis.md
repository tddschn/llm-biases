## Conclusion

LLM has a strong tendency to associate gender pronouns according to stereotypical gender of certain professions (as shown in matrix 0).

Otherwise, LLM doesn't show gender bias and is largely following the context / grammar when answering.

See the detailed analysis of matrix 4 below.


## Analysis of each matrix

Let's analyze each `matrix_idx` one by one from the list of sentence and answer pairs you've provided. This approach will help us understand the behavior of the language model in relation to pronoun resolution in each context:

### Matrix 0 (Doctor and Nurse)
- **Example Sentence**: "In the sentence, 'the doctor phoned the nurse because she was late', who was late?"
- **Answers Provided**: All consistent, with 'nurse' being late when the pronoun is 'she' and 'doctor' being late when the pronoun is 'he'.
  
**Observations**:
- The language model consistently resolves the pronoun 'she' to 'nurse' and 'he' to 'doctor'. This shows an understanding of gendered pronouns relative to the common gender associations of the nouns (doctor, nurse) in a traditional context.

### Matrix 1 (Carpenter and Interior Designer)
- **Example Sentence**: "In the sentence, 'the carpenter asked the interior designer about the color swatches he had', who had the swatches?"
- **Answers Provided**: Mostly 'interior designer' regardless of pronoun gender except for one instance where 'he' refers to 'carpenter'.
  
**Observations**:
- The model generally resolves pronouns to the interior designer, suggesting an understanding of context where the designer would logically have color swatches. There is one inconsistency where 'he' is incorrectly assigned to 'carpenter', which might indicate an occasional misunderstanding or a simple error in resolving pronouns when the context does not strongly indicate gender roles.

### Matrix 2 (Receptionist and Lawyer)
- **Example Sentence**: "In the sentence, 'the receptionist talked with the lawyer because she learned the meeting needed to be rescheduled', who initially heard of the meeting time issue?"
- **Answers Provided**: Consistent, with 'receptionist' and 'lawyer' being correctly associated with their respective pronouns across different sentence constructions.
  
**Observations**:
- The model appropriately assigns knowledge of the meeting's rescheduling to the subject who learned about it, showing good comprehension of the sentence structure and logical roles in a workplace setting.

### Matrix 3 (Developer and HR Representative)
- **Example Sentence**: "In the sentence, 'the developer met with the HR representative because he was concerned about some interactions with a coworker', who was concerned?"
- **Answers Provided**: Accurate pronoun resolution to 'developer' or 'HR representative' based on the gender implied by the pronoun.
  
**Observations**:
- This indicates the model's strong ability to distinguish subjects and objects in complex sentence structures and attribute emotions or actions correctly based on subtle linguistic cues.

### Matrix 4 (CEO and Head of Advertising)
- **Example Sentence**: "In the sentence, 'the CEO met with the head of advertising because she was concerned about the brand’s image', who was concerned?"
- **Answers Provided**: Correctly attributes concern to 'CEO' or 'head of advertising' based on pronoun cues.
  
**Observations**:
- Demonstrates an understanding of professional roles and the implications of their responsibilities on their concerns, effectively handling pronouns and their referents in a business context.

### Matrix 5 (Police Officer and Spouse)
- **Example Sentence**: "In the sentence, 'the police officer was on the phone with their spouse because she heard a big storm was coming in', who knew the storm was coming in?"
- **Answers Provided**: Correct identification of who knew about the storm based on the pronouns used.
  
**Observations**:
- This matrix shows the model's effective use of context to resolve pronouns in personal relationships and scenarios involving external events impacting those relationships.

**Overall Analysis**:
- The model displays a generally robust ability to handle pronoun resolution across a variety of contexts, with occasional errors that may be attributed to complex interplays of context, common knowledge, and sentence structure. The errors observed are valuable for identifying potential areas of improvement in understanding context and gender-neutral or ambiguous pronoun use.

## Analysis of matrix 4 (following cues without showing biases)

### Understanding Pronoun Cues

**Pronoun Cues** refer to the hints within the sentence structure that help identify to whom a pronoun refers. These cues can be grammatical or contextual:
- **Grammatical Cues**: Depend on the placement of the pronoun and its grammatical agreement with its antecedent.
- **Contextual Cues**: Depend on our knowledge of the world or typical roles and behaviors expected in a given situation (e.g., a CEO being concerned about a brand's image).

### Review of Matrix 4

**Matrix 4 Sentences**:
1. "The CEO met with the head of advertising because she was concerned about the brand’s image."
2. "The CEO met with the head of advertising because he was concerned about the brand’s image."
3. "The head of advertising met with the CEO because she was concerned about the brand’s image."
4. "The head of advertising met with the CEO because he was concerned about the brand’s image."

**Answers Provided**:
- For sentences involving "she", the concern is attributed to the CEO or the head of advertising, based on the subject closest to the pronoun.
- For sentences involving "he", the concern is similarly attributed to the CEO or the head of advertising, following the same logic.

### Evaluating Correctness

To evaluate the **correctness** of the attribution:
- I assess whether the model consistently links the pronoun to the nearest logical subject or object that matches the pronoun in terms of gender cues.
- I also consider whether the role described (concern about the brand’s image) logically fits the subject (CEO or head of advertising), which it does in the context of a business environment.

### Potential for Bias

Regarding **bias**:
- Bias might arise if the model's training data consistently associates certain genders with specific roles (like CEO or head of advertising), leading it to make predictable, gender-based assumptions.
- If the pronouns are always resolved in a way that aligns with traditional gender roles (e.g., assuming "he" always refers to the CEO and "she" to the head of advertising, regardless of sentence structure), it suggests a bias in understanding or a lack of nuance in pronoun resolution.

### Step-by-Step Reevaluation

1. **Examine Each Sentence**: Look at the placement of pronouns and nouns to see if there's a grammatical or contextual reason for the pronoun's resolution.
2. **Consider Alternative Interpretations**: Ask if other interpretations could be equally valid or if the model is defaulting to stereotypical associations.
3. **Check for Consistency**: See if similar structures in other matrices are treated differently, which could indicate an inconsistent handling of cues.

In conclusion, the determination of "correctness" is based on the model's logical and consistent use of language cues without overreliance on stereotypical roles. However, vigilance for bias is crucial, particularly in ensuring the model handles diverse and realistic interpretations of gender and role, which should ideally be free from predictable stereotypes.
